                    <p align="justify">The goal of our project is to develop a low-cost, all-in-one (AIO) photovoltaic (PV) sensor device which will allow our customer, the Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC), to gather data from their solar panel arrays. The all-in-one sensor will be able to collect voltage, current, temperature, and irradiance directly from the customer’s solar panels. The data that our solution will provide the customer with includes numerous benefits. Firstly, through voltage and current values collected at each panel in an array will allow for technicians to detect a faulty panel in an easy-to-use manner. This solution would significantly reduce loss of power generation when a panel becomes faulty as this would reduce the time [and money] it would take for a technician to identify a faulty panel. Secondly, our solution will collect large amounts of granular data for OUC to generate accurate representations of temperature and irradiance at a solar panel array over a period, as well as energy collected over a period.
